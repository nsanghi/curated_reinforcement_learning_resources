# Curated Reinfrocement Learning Resources
1. Text Book - [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. This is a must read for any practitioner of RL. The book is divided into 3 parts and I would strongly recommend reading through Parts I and II. The sections marked with (*) can be skipped in first reading. And if you click on [this](http://incompleteideas.net/book/code/code2nd.html), you will see the links of python and Matlab implementations of the examples and exercises contained in the book.
2. [Video Lectures by David Silver](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/). These lectures are wonderful and easy to understand introduction to RL, the basics and some advanced topics. I highly recommend watching these in a sequential manner.
3. [Deep RL Course by Assistant Professor Sergey Levine](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) of UC Berkeley. As of now you have complete set of video lectures, slides and python assignments available for the Fall 2020 offering. It goes deeper into derivations and have significant math. However, if you have a good background on Linear Algebra, Probability theory and Calculus, it would be very rewarding to go through this material.
4.  [Reinforcement Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) at Coursera offered by University of Albera, the same university where Sutton and Barto are Professors at. 
5.  [Deep RL Bootcamp - 2017](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures). These are video recordings of a 2 day bootcamp in 2017 organized at UC Berkeley by Professor Pieter Abbeel. A good set of video recordings with a decent overlap with the material covered in Sergey Levine's course.
6.  [Stanford's Reinforcement Learning Course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/). Again an excellent introduction to the field of Reinforcement Learning. While the material is available for currently underway Winter 2021 run of the course, complete with presentations, notes and assignment, the videos are not available for free viewing. You can checkout the videos of 2019 run [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgzM3zpZ55o).
7.  [Practical Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl) by HSE University Moscow. It is a very well paced course covering the basics to advance topics. However, at times I found the coverage of material to be a bit too high level for my likings. Their coding exercises are great though. Yon can also check out their latest iteration of the course at [github](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL).
8.  [Advanced Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/reinforcement-learning-lectures-series-2018) taught by DeepMind Scientists at University College London (UCL). It also covers the fundamentals and advance topics. The material has good overlap with the material covered in David Silver's video lectures. 
9.  [Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/), a web page with a python library hosted by OpenAI which is yet another great resource to dive deep into RL. In my view this material is a great resource to cement your understanding after going through the basic courses. Or you could dive right into it if you are comfortable with Deep Learning and PyTorch or TensorFlow.
